# Census2011-of-India
Data analysis on the Population of India using SQL
Here I used aggregated function( count(),avg(),sum()), where clause, group by, order by to find the solution of easy problem statement. 
here I also used join and union operator to combine two table. 
also used subqueries to find the solution of complex problem statement like population of previous census based on growth rate of each state. 
used window function like rank to give rank to top 3 district of each state based on population.
used logical approach while writing formula instead of writing traditional lengthy formula to find the Population of male and female.
